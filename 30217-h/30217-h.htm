<h2>Pleistocene Bats from San Josecito Cave,<br />
Nuevo León, México</h2>

<p class="center"><small>BY</small><br /><br />

J. KNOX JONES, JR.<br /></p>


<p>Some of the Pleistocene mammals from San Josecito Cave, near
Aramberri, Nuevo León, México, collected by field parties of the
California Institute of Technology under the direction of the late
Professor Chester Stock, have been reported previously (see Furlong,
1943; Cushing, 1945; Stock, 1950; Hooper, 1952; Findley,
1953; Stock, 1953; Handley, 1955; Jackway, 1958). In 1950, Professor
Stock loaned a portion of the San Josecito material to the
University of Kansas for identification. Included therein were 89
crania and rami of bats, representing three families (Phyllostomidae,
Desmodontidae and Vespertilionidae) and five genera, each represented
by a single species. One of the species is here described as
new. Three of the kinds are known only from the Pleistocene and
two are Recent species.</p>

<p>The only previous mention of fossil bats from México known to
me concerns material from San Josecito Cave. Cushing (1945:182)
mentioned a "vampire bat" from the cave (see also Maldonado-Koerdell,
1948:17), and Handley (1955:48) based his description of
<i>Corynorhinus tetralophodon</i> on a specimen from San Josecito.</p>

<p>Brief descriptions of the cave have been published by Miller
(1943) and Stock (1943). The precise age of the deposits is unknown;
stratification data did not accompany the material sent
on loan to the University of Kansas. However, most of the micro-fauna
is thought to have come from the higher levels in the cave
and is probably late Pleistocene.</p>

<p>The San Josecito Cave collections are currently the property of
the Los Angeles County Museum.</p>

<p>I am grateful to Dr. E. Raymond Hall for permission to study the
bats from San Josecito Cave, to Dr. Robert W. Wilson for criticism
of the manuscript, and to Mr. Philip Hershkovitz for permission to
use comparative material at the Chicago Natural History Museum.

Legler.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span></p>
<h3><i>Leptonycteris nivalis</i> (Saussure)</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Referred material.</i>&mdash;Seventy crania, LACM (CIT) 2951-54, 2956-64,
3114-22, 3124-25, 3127, 3131-35, 3137-41, 3143-55, 3942, 21 unnumbered,
of which 35 are nearly complete, lacking zygomatic arches, auditory bullae
and some teeth; three rami, one right, LACM (CIT) 3126, and two left, unnumbered.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;The long-nosed bats from San Josecito Cave do not
differ appreciably from <i>Leptonycteris nivalis longala</i> Stains, the
largest Recent subspecies of the species, and the subspecies that
occurs in the same geographic area today. Average and extremes
of three cranial measurements of 22 specimens from San Josecito
Cave, followed in parentheses by the average and extreme measurements
of 23 adult <i>L. n. longala</i> from the type locality, 12 mi. S and
2 mi. E Arteaga, 7500 ft., Coahuila (after Stains, 1957: 356), are:
Greatest length of skull, 28.2, 27.2-28.9 (27.5, 26.1-29.0); least interorbital
constriction, 5.0, 4.8-5.4 (4.8, 4.1-5.4); breadth of braincase,
11.1, 10.6-11.6 (10.7, 10.1-11.2). The San Josecito specimens average
larger than the series of Recent specimens in all of these measurements,
especially breadth of braincase, but there is considerable
overlap in each case and the extremes of greatest length of skull
and of least interorbital constriction do not exceed the extremes in
the Recent series.</p>


<h3><i>Desmodus stocki</i>, new species</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Holotype.</i>&mdash;Cranium, lacking post-incisor dentition on the left side, zygomatic
arches and auditory bullae; Los Angeles County Museum (CIT) No.
3129; from Pleistocene deposits of San Josecito Cave, near Aramberri, Nuevo
León, México.</p>

<p><i>Referred material.</i>&mdash;Twelve additional partial crania, LACM (CIT) 2946-50,
3127-30, 3940-41, 2 unnumbered.</p>

<p><i>Diagnosis.</i>&mdash;Resembling the Recent <i>Desmodus rotundus</i> but differing from
it as follows: Skull larger (see measurements and <a href="#figs1-4">Figs. 1-2</a>), heavier and
more massive; rostrum and braincase relatively as well as actually broader,
interorbital region relatively more constricted; braincase more rounded (less
elongate) as viewed from above; nasals less concave in lateral view; narial
vacuity broader in relation to greatest length of skull, more nearly heart-shaped;
palate broad, less concave medially; mesopterygoid fossa relatively and actually
broader anteriorly, the sides nearly parallel; zygomatic arches (judging from
No. 2950, the only specimen with a complete arch, the left) less rounded in
outline, appearing broader owing to the more constricted interorbital region.</p>

<p>Dentition larger and heavier than that in <i>rotundus</i>, but otherwise differing
only slightly from it; upper incisor less concave on cutting surface (see Figs.
3-4); premolar and molar slightly less bladelike, with heavier roots.</p>

<p>The peculiar shape of the incisor of <i>stocki</i> is shared to some extent with
Diaemus youngi, a Recent South American desmodontid. However, <i>stocki</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
does not otherwise resemble <i>D. youngi</i>, differing from it as follows: Skull
larger and heavier; interorbital constriction much narrower; zygomatic arches
less strongly bowed; skull less compact, more elongate; braincase and rostrum
relatively much narrower in relation to greatest length of skull. Furthermore,
specimens of stocki show no trace of the minute M2 attributed to <i>youngi</i> by de
la Torre (Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 69: 191, 1956). For cranial measurements
of <i>youngi</i> see Sanborn (Jour. Mamm., 30: 283, 1949).</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;The essential differences between <i>D. stocki</i> and <i>D.
rotundus</i> are in size and proportion. I do not doubt that the two
species are closely related; possibly <i>stocki</i> is ancestral to <i>rotundus</i>.</p>

<p>The species is named in honor of the late Professor Chester Stock,
under whose direction the fossil materials from San Josecito Cave
were obtained, and who, at the time of his death, was studying the
mammalian fauna from the cave.</p>


<h3><i>Eptesicus cf. grandis</i> (Brown)</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Referred material.</i>&mdash;One rostrum, with P4-M3 on the right side and P4
only on the left, LACM (CIT) 2990.</p></div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;This specimen is referred provisionally to <i>E. grandis</i>.
The dentition is larger and heavier, and the ridges and depressions
on the dorsal surface of the rostrum are more pronounced than
in Recent <i>E. fuscus</i>. The P4-M3 length is 6.1 (approximately 6.1
in the holotype of <i>grandis</i>, less in <i>fuscus</i>); least interorbital constriction,
4.2 (4.3 in the holotype of <i>grandis</i>, more in <i>fuscus</i>); breadth
of rostrum between infraorbital canals, 6.4; breadth across P4, 7.3.</p>

<p>Brown (1908:174) originally named <i>grandis</i> as a subspecies of
<i>fuscus</i>. Gidley and Gazin (1938:11) considered it a distinct species.
Whether <i>grandis</i> is only a subspecies of <i>E. fuscus</i> or a separate
species, <i>grandis</i> is closely related to <i>fuscus</i>, and probably is ancestral
to it.</p>


<h3><i>Lasiurus cinereus</i> (Palisot de Beauvois)</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Referred material</i>.&mdash;One cranium, lacking basioccipital, tympanic and mastoid
regions, and most of the dentition, having only M3 on the right side and
M2-M3 on the left, LACM (CIT) 3160.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;The cranium of No. 3160 is inseparable from those
of 10 spring-taken specimens of <i>L. c. cinereus</i> from the San Gabriel
Mts., Los Angeles Co., California (KU 49727, 49729-37). Measurements
of No. 3160, followed by the average and extremes (in parentheses)
of the Californian series, are: Condylobasal length, 16.1,
16.5 (15.9-17.2); zygomatic breadth, 12.3, 12.4 (12.0-12.7); least
interorbital constriction, 5.2, 5.4 (5.2-5.6); breadth of braincase,
8.7, 9.0 (8.5-9.3); length of palate not including terminal spine,
5.1, 5.3 (4.8-5.9). The teeth of the San Josecito specimen are comparatively
unworn. A label with the skull bears the notation "talus"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
in parentheses, which, in so far as I am able to determine, indicates
surface talus inside the cave. Therefore, the specimen in question
may be of Recent origin.</p>

<p>It is perhaps worthy of note that Lasiurus cinereus is primarily a
tree-dwelling bat, although a few Recent specimens have been reported
from caves (see Beer, 1954:116).</p>


<h3><i>Corynorhinus tetralophodon</i> Handley</h3>

<p>A single cranium of a <i>Corynorhinus</i> LACM (CIT) 2989 was included
in the original materials sent to Kansas by Professor Stock.
Subsequently, this specimen was loaned to Charles O. Handley, Jr.,
who described it as a new species, <i>C. tetralophodon</i>. The latter is
said to differ from all other plecotine bats by the retention of a
well-developed fourth commissure (ridge extending posteroexternally
from metacone) on the M3 (Handley, 1955:48).</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
